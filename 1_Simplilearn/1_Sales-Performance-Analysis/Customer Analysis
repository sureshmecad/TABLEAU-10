DESCRIPTION

Mary Miles, the head of Sales for a retail products company, is responsible for increasing business from the company’s customers. Mary wants to build a dashboard that will present some statistics about the customers, a ranking of the customers by Profit Ratio, and a breakdown of each customer’s sales and profit performance. This information will be broken down by Region so Mary can analyze the differences in customers across the company’s geography. Mary also wants to be able to break down the information by Segment, by Category, and by Year or Order Date.
